# RISCV-32I
RTL Implementation of 5 Stage RV32I ISA
### How to Run
Clone the Repo. Once a vivado project is opened add all the file in the /core folder as design sources. Making sure that riscv_cpu is the top module.

As for the testing-infrastructure, add the files in the /test folder as simulation sources. Any binary that wishes to be run can be placed in the Test_Binary, ensuring that last instruction in the binary is a 32'd0.
